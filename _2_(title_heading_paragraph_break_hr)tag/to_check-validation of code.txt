to know errors we use html validator.
like:
	1: validator.w3.org
in this website we can add the file which we want to check.
	>we must have to use lang="en" in body tag to declared that we are using english language.


	>we also have to use <meta charset="UTF-8"> to declare which english language character we are going to be used.
